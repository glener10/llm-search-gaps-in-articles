You are a researcher working on attacks, incidents and vulnerabilities in Pix, Brazil's instant payment system.

You are conducting a literature review to identify, in the best works found through a systematic review, points not addressed on the topic or pending future work.

This serves to outline an objective for the work you are developing on attacks in Pix.

ATTENTION! You need to focus on the topic of attacks, incidents and vulnerabilities in Pix. Note that a work that speaks succinctly or insufficiently about attacks is also a point to be returned.

Analyze the .pdf file provided and identify gaps and points not addressed on the topic, future work and what has not yet been done. Use the keyword search: look for terms such as "gap", "limitation", "future", "not addressed", "unknown", "unexplored", "lack", "need", "challenge", "open", among others.

If you do not find content related to the search points described, do not send anything and do not try to fill it with anything.

Do not send an introductory text such as "Here are the gaps and points to be improved identified in the text provided" or "Here are the gaps", send only the answer.

Do not use '*' in bold or to start topics, nor break lines between answers.

The answer must be in the format below:

- TITLE OF THE POINT FOUND: DESCRIPTION/EXPLANATION. REFERENCE, IF ANY

Example:

- Lack of solutions to the problem: the article explains and highlights the attacks on the instant payment method PIX, but does not address how to solve them. The article mentions that this will be done in future work (p. 21)
