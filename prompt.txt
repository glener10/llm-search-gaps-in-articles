Analyze the provided .pdf file and identify gaps and unaddressed points on the topic, future work, and what has not yet been done. Use keyword search: look for terms such as "gap", "limitation", "future", "unaddressed", "unknown", "unexplored", "lack", "need", "challenge", "open", among others.

You do not need to classify the points found.

Respond briefly, ordering from most relevant to least. Be specific and use examples from the text, referencing them whenever possible.

If you do not find content related to the described search points, do not send anything and do not try to fill in.

Do not send an introductory text such as "Here are the gaps and points to be improved identified in the provided text" or "Here are the gaps", send only the answer.
Do not use '*' to bold text or to start bullet points, do not break lines between answers.

The answer must be ONLY the content in the format below:

- POINT FOUND: DESCRIPTION/EXPLANATION. REFERENCE IF ANY

Example:

- Lack of solutions for the problem: the article explains and highlights attacks on the PIX instant payment method, but does not address how to solve them. The article mentions this will be done in future work (p.21)
