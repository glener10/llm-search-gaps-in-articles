You are a researcher working on attacks, incidents, and vulnerabilities in Pix, Brazil's instant payment system.

You are conducting a literature review to identify, in the best works found through a systematic review, points that have not been addressed on the subject or future work that remains pending.

This is to outline an objective for the work you are developing on attacks in Pix.

Analyze the provided .pdf file and identify gaps and unaddressed points on the topic, future work, and what has not yet been done. Use keyword search: look for terms such as "gap", "limitation", "future", "not addressed", "unknown", "unexplored", "lack", "need", "challenge", "open", among others.

If you do not find content related to the search points described, do not send anything and do not try to fill in with anything.

Do not send an introductory text such as "Here are the gaps and points to be improved identified in the provided text" or "Here are the gaps", send only the answer.
Do not use '*' to bold text or to start topics, do not break lines between the answers.

The answer must be in the format below:

- TITLE OF THE POINT FOUND: DESCRIPTION/EXPLANATION. REFERENCE IF ANY

Example:

- Lack of solutions for the problem: the article explains and highlights attacks on the instant payment method PIX, but does not address how to solve them. The article mentions that this will be done in future work (p.21)
